# Information
PyGitClone is a Python Git cloner to get Github repositories. You may find this script more useful than Git 
since it has one feature Git doesn't have... __mass cloning!__

## Requirements
In order to run the software, you will need:
          
```
- A Github account with repos
- Python 3 and the GitPython module
- A recent version of Git
```

I'm pretty sure you know where to get everything.

## How to use
The program doesn't use input. It instead uses parameters you can specify by running the program in a terminal or command prompt.
You specify the name and the repo. Below are some examples.

## Examples

Getting a single repo from llk:
```
py main.py llk scratch-gui
```
Getting every repo from llk:
```
py main.py llk *
```
